:rocket: **Clipboard is a power tool that saves you time and effort.** Previously, you've always had to think about where exactly you want to move text and files. This increases your mental workload and makes some scenarios simply impractical. 
Now, you can have a _unified_ clipboard to use anywhere in the command line, just as if you were using a GUI.

- **Quick.** Zero configuration needed to use.
- **Easy.** Friendly to newbies and power users alike.
- **Compatible.** Works on any system that supports C++23. Really!
- **Unified.** Functions exactly the same everywhere.
- **Universal.** Supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish.
- **Integrated.** Connects with [many](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/wiki/GUI-Clipboard-Compat) native GUI clipboards.
- **Tiny.** Mere tens of kilobytes in size.

---


**Cut** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]cut|[-]ct)[(num)|_(id)] (file) [files]`

---

**Paste** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]paste|[-]p)[(num)|_(id)]`

---

**Pipe In** &emsp; `(something) | clipboard [([--]copy|[-]cp)][(num)|_(id)]`

---

**Pipe Out** &emsp; `clipboard [([--]paste|[-]p][(num)|_(id)] | (something)` or `clipboard [([--]paste|[-]p)][(num)|_(id)] > (some file)`

---

**Show Contents** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]show|[-]sh)[(num)|_(id)]`

---

**Clear Contents** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]clear|[-]clr)[(num)|_(id)]`

![Simple Configuration](documentation/readme-banners/CBSimpleConfiguration.png)

### **Environment Variables**

**`CI`** &emsp; Set this to make Clipboard overwrite existing items without a user prompt when pasting. This variable is intended for Continuous Integration scripts where a live human is not present to make decisions.

---

**`FORCE_COLOR`** &emsp; Set this to make Clipboard always show color regardless of what you set `NO_COLOR` to.

---

**`TMPDIR`** &emsp; Set this to the directory that Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a temporary directory. Other programs use `TMPDIR` as well, so be careful about changing this.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_TMPDIR`** &emsp; Set this to the directory that only Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a temporary directory.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_PERSISTDIR`** &emsp; Set this to the directory that only Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a persistent directory.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_ALWAYS_PERSIST`** &emsp; Set this to make Clipboard always use persistent clipboards.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_NOGUI`** &emsp; Set this to disable integration with GUI clipboards.

---

**`NO_COLOR`** &emsp; Set this to make Clipboard not show any colors.

</details>

---

### **Flags**

**`--fast-copy`, `-fc`** &emsp; Add this to use links when copying, cutting, or pasting. If you modify the items that you used with this flag, then the items you paste will have the same changes.
